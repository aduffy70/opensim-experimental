NAME
CellularAutomata

DESCRIPTION
An OpenSimulator (http://www.opensimulator.org) region module to demonstrate continuous cellular automata.

BUILD NOTES
This module uses several libraries that I have not included.  The expectation is that the CellularAutomata/ folder will be placed in the addon-modules/ folder of your OpenSimulator installation.  This will provide access to all required libraries.

USAGE NOTES


TODO
In no particular order...
Document installation, configuration, and use.
Test module on opensim instances with multiple regions per instance and make necessary changes (All my test regions are a single region per opensim instance).
Add configuration file or commands to allow users changes.
