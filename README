NAME
Visit-Logger

DESCRIPTION
An OpenSimulator (http://www.opensimulator.org) region module to log visitors and notify the sim owner of visits.

BUILD NOTES
This module uses several libraries that I have not included.  The expectation is that the Visit-Logger/ folder will be placed in the addon-modules/ folder of your OpenSimulator installation.  This will provide access to all required libraries except one.  The Twitterizer library (Twitterizer.FrameWork.dll) must be downloaded separately and placed in the bin/ folder of your OpenSimulator installation. http://twitterizer.googlecode.com/files/Twitterizer.Framework-1.0.1.120.zip

USAGE NOTES
This module uses a Twitter account to log visitors and suggestions.  Do not use your normal Twitter account with this module - all of your followers will be spammed with Tweets everytime you have a visitor.  Set up a new account for this module and then follow the new account with your normal account.

TODO
In no particular order...
Add the option to log to a file.
Add the code for emailed notifications back in and make the choice of logging/notification methods a configurable option.
Provide tools to summarize visit data.
Document limitations (how many calls to the Twitter API are allowed in 24 hours?  Is the post length really limited to 140 characters?)
Document installation, configuration, and use.
Pull necessary 3rd party libraries into the project (in a way that is appropriate for their individual licenses).
Test module on opensim instances with multiple regions per instance and make necessary changes (All my test regions are a single region per opensim instance).
