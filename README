NAME
ConwaysGOL

DESCRIPTION
An OpenSimulator (http://www.opensimulator.org) region module to demonstrate Conway's Game of Life on the surface of a toroid

BUILD NOTES
This module uses several libraries that I have not included.  The expectation is that the ConwaysGOL/ folder will be placed in the addon-modules/ folder of your OpenSimulator installation.  This will provide access to all required libraries.

USAGE NOTES


TODO
In no particular order...
Document installation, configuration, and use.
Pull necessary 3rd party libraries into the project (in a way that is appropriate for their individual licenses).
Test module on opensim instances with multiple regions per instance and make necessary changes (All my test regions are a single region per opensim instance).
Add commands to allow users to change the starting pattern.
