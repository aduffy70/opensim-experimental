NAME
vMeadow

DESCRIPTION
An OpenSimulator (http://www.opensimulator.org) region module to generate a virtual meadow with a community structure that changes over time based on a cellular automata system.  Initially based on the model used in Silvertown et al. 1992. Cellular automaton models of interspecific competition for space-- the effect of pattern on process. Journal of Ecology 80:527-533.

BUILD NOTES
This module uses several libraries that I have not included.  The expectation is that the vMeadow/ folder will be placed in the addon-modules/ folder of your OpenSimulator installation.  This will provide access to all required libraries.

USAGE NOTES
To generate a randomized meadow and run the cellular automata calculations, chat '/18 reset'.
To start the visualization, chat '/18 forward'.
To run the visualization in reverse, chat '/18 reverse'.
To stop the visualization, chat '/18 stop'.
To view a particular visualization step, chat '/18 #'.
To view the next step, chat '/18 +'.
To view the previous step, chat '/18 -'.
To remove the meadow, chat '/18 clear'.
To load a new set of parameters follow the instructions on the vmeadowga form.


TODO
In no particular order...
Document installation, configuration, and use.
Test module on opensim instances with multiple regions per instance and make necessary changes (All my test regions are a single region per opensim instance).
