A collection of experimental opensim region modules and related Google
AppEngine-based webapps. These modules have been tested successfully on
Opensim 0.7.4-Dev running on Ubuntu 10.4 with mono 2.6.7, with a single 
region per opensim instance.
I am sharing these only for their potential value as examples for others
learning to create opensim region modules.  I cannot and will not provide 
support for these.
