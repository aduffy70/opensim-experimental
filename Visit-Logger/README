NAME
Visit-Logger

DESCRIPTION
An OpenSimulator (http://www.opensimulator.org) region module to log visitors.

BUILD NOTES
This module uses several libraries that I have not included.  The expectation is that the Visit-Logger/ folder will be placed in the addon-modules/ folder of your OpenSimulator installation.  This will provide access to all required libraries

USAGE NOTES
This module logs visitors to your choice of a local file or an online logging tool (such as the visitloggerga tool at visitlog.aduffy70.org).
To use local logging, you specify a local folder in  the VisitLogger.ini file.  The log will be stored in the specified folder as VisitLog.csv
To use the online tool, this module needs a google account ID (a gmail address, for example) to associate with the records.  It does NOT need any login info such as your password. To view the log records, direct your browser to the logging tool url (visitlog.aduffy70.org).  You will be redirected to Google's Authorization page to login and will then be able to see the records associated with your google account (this prevents anyone else from accessing your log records).

TODO
In no particular order...
Document installation, configuration, and use.
Test module on opensim instances with multiple regions per instance and make necessary changes (All my test regions are a single region per opensim instance).
